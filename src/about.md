---

I am currently an instructor of English within the professional writing program at Western Kentucky University. I earned my PhD from Florida State University in the Summer of 2021. I also hold at MA from the University of Nebraska-Omaha and a BA from Creighton University. 

I am originally from Omaha Nebraska and I enjoy running in my free time. I am contemplating training for a marathon. I also enjoy cooking, community markets, and baking bread.

My partner and I have a golden retriever who keeps us on track with our work and around home.

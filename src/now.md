title: What I'm Doing Now
---

I'm currently teaching four classes, including Writing in the Disciplines, Business Writing, and Technical Writing. 

I'm teaching a special section of my Writing in the Disciplines that is directed towards students in art, design, and making disciplines. It has been a fun experience to think about tailoring the class for these students through adapting research and writing assignments through design thinking, prototyping, and testing.

This fall I attended the Feminisms and Rhetorics conference, where I presented a paper on feminist methodologies for approaching data driven projects and utilizing data visualization. It was great to catch up with many old friends and colleagues and to make some new connections.

I am currently working on an article manuscript for publication about the historiography of _techne_ as emergent from a corpus derived from 1990s Rhetoric and Composition field journals.

Additionally,I have  been facilitating a peer-mentoring research and writing group for the college.
I am also seeking out opportunities for digital humanities collaborations at WKU with the exploration of a working group.

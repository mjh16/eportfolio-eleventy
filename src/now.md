title: What I'm doing now
---
I'm currently teaching four classes, including Writing in the Disciplines, Business Writing, and Technical Writing. 

I'm enjoying a special section of my Writing in the Disciplines that is specifically directed towards students in art, design, and making disciplines. It has been a fun experience to think about tailoring the class for these students, and to adapt assignments and content with these students in mind.

I am preparing for the Feminisms and Rhetorics conference, where I will be presenting a paper on feminist methodologies for approaching data driven projects and utilizing data visualization. I will also be working at the conference as one of the co-archivist and historians for the coalition.

I am currently working on a manuscript for publication about the historiography of _techne_ as emergent from a corpus derived from 1990s Rhetoric and Composition field journals.

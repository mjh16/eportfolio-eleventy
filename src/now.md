title: What I'm Doing Now
---

I'm currently teaching an accelerated winter term Writing in the Disciplines. This asynchronous online course is going well so far, and I'm really enjoying the students and their perspectives.

I am also taking the time during this break to dive into some reading and back into data sets for an article manuscript about historiograpies of _techne_ as emergent from a corpus derived from 1990s Rhetoric and Composition field journals. My goal is to have a manuscript submitted for review by the end of the spring 2024 semester.

Additionally,I have  been working to prepare for the spring semester. I have organized the initial dates for the PCAL writing and research group's spring meetings. I am also preparing to teach some new courses in the spring, including the graduate course, Introduction to Technical and Professioanl Writing.

## Agenda

My research interests are varied, but they orbit the questions: what do we mean when we teach writing? What is writing? What counts as writing? What writing counts?

With these questions, I'm deeply interested in issues of *techne*, and how assumptions about what writing is influence our perceptions of what writing does, how one writes, and how and if we can teach writing.

My research examines historiographies of rhetoric and composition using digital humanities methods and data feminist methodologies to examine assumptions about the field and disciplinary epistemologies. I am currently researching 1990s field scholarship for the impressions of *techne* with an aim to better understand current uptakes of *techne* and to interrogate current theories and pedagogies relating to technology, invention, and creativity, and how those assumptions influence notions of design and making.

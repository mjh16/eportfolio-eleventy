# Teaching Philosophy
My teaching philosophy has been shaped by my own varied experiences in rhetoric, composition, creative writing, and technology, which I seek to bring meaningfully into my classes. I engage with students in learning as we work to become more just, more aware, and more effective rhetorical agents. I see the labor of every class—from first-year composition to rhetoric to the history of text technologies—as developing students’ agency to interrupt the world and act critically as we work towards social justice. In order to create engaged classrooms that work toward social justice, my teaching is student centered, collaborative, and playful.

## Student-Centered Networks
My teaching and my teaching philosophy are student centered with a focus on developing thinkers and writers who are intentional and impactful with their languaging practices. My teaching is structured on the idea of a rhetorical ecology—that we make meaning through our interactions with each other, our technologies, and our languages in network of intersecting relationship—where students inquire into their roles as people and agents in a world of fluid language. Students already bring their experiences, insights, and needs into the classroom, and I incorporate them into lessons, readings, assignments, and revisions to the class. To invite student knowledge and experiences into my rhetoric class I guide students through a curation practice where they select topics of interest and vote on two articles to incorporate into the content of the course.

This ecological framework encourages students to develop connections between what they want to say with the resources and technologies that are available to them, including the right mix of modes, mediums, and composing tools to meet those goals. Students in my Writing and Editing in Print and Online course work through their own ecologies as they enact a viral marketing campaign with print and digital materials. Working in teams throughout the semester, students identify a community, construct a proposal, and collaboratively enact an impactful DIY marketing campaign. Through guided inquiry, students seek out connections between each other and resources on campus such as the library, writing center, and digital maker spaces in their work. Many of my courses feature an ePortfolio, developed throughout the semester, to explicitly provide students the opportunity to connect the content of the class to their practices and learning through the selection and reflection upon their work and learning and presented in a cohesive way for an outside audience.

## Dynamic and Collaborative
Students are challenged to move beyond their comfort levels in my highly dynamic classes through discussions on readings, group and individual exploratory activities, and assignments focused on student inquiry and exploration. A cornerstone of my approach to teaching is small group discussion, where I pose questions drawn from students’ discussion in prior classes and from informal writing ahead of and during the class period. I affirm their insights, individually and together, and challenge the assumptions that they bring. Much of the labor of classes is done collaboratively with guidance, structure, and questions from me. In my History of Text Technologies class, students collaborate in small groups and across the class to curate items for an online archive of text technologies and propose and develop exhibits out of the crowdsourced archive. 

## Playful
I see play as serious intellectual work and vitally important for teasing out and experiencing the rhetorical nature of composing. I encourage students to make and remake with a variety of materials and technologies to identify and respond to different contexts inside and outside of the classroom. In my sections of Research, Genre, and Context—a sophomore-level college composition class—students remediate their research projects into three new genres to see and experiences their choices and agency as composers, working across a number of constraints in materials and delivery to reach new audiences. I encourage students to think creatively and intentionally as they make with language and reflect on their experiences, and have students articulate their experiences within theoretical frameworks to support their learning.

## Justice Oriented
Finally, I intentionally seek to create classrooms that work for social justice. I adopted labor-based grading contracts within my college composition classrooms, drawing on the anti-racist pedagogy developed by Asao Inoue, where labor is the basis of grades instead of an adherence to a subjective and hegemonic standard. I seek student feedback daily and work to adjust the classroom based on their experiences and expectations. I weave diversity within my courses crafting intellectual foundations from a variety of viewpoints and marginalized voices. I want the work of a class to continue to simmer with students as they go to their other classes prepared to take action, and to view their work in my classes as part of their learning process and development as writers and thinkers who are able to act meaningfully as they engage in their worlds.

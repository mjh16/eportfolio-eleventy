# Eleventy ePortfolio

## New ePortfolio

So I've been working to update my ePortfolio and I'm not using [@11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), which I think is pretty cool. The site itself will be pretty simple, hosting a landing/about me page, a teaching page with philosophy and course descriptions, my CV, some featured projects, and if I'm feeling up to it, a blog of some sort. So far I've accomplished:
- [x] CSS
- [x] 11ty workflow
- [x] Main Page Content
- [x] CV
- [x] About me
- [x] Now
 - Current teaching
 - Service
- [x] Teaching
 - Teaching philosophy
 - Past courses brief description
- [ ] Writing
- [ ] Course archive
- [ ] Blog?

# Eleventy ePortfolio

## New ePortfolio

So I've been working to update my ePortfolio and I'm not using [@11ty](https://www.11ty.dev), which I think is pretty cool. The site itself will be pretty simple, hosting a landing/about me page, a course archive with syllabi, my CV, some featured projects, and if I'm feeling up to it, a blog of some sort. Check back in soon to see if there is actually anything here!
